# Sleep Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sleep patterns using data from the Physionet Sleep Accelerometer Dataset [1]. The aim was to extract meaningful insights from sleep data to aid in sleep research. See _sleep_analysis_report.pdf_ for detailed analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- Necessary Python libraries: Install them using the requirements.txt file provided in the repository. You can do this by running the command:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Acquisition

To run the code, you must first download the required dataset. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the Physionet Sleep Accelerometer Dataset at [Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-accel/1.0.0/labels/#files-panel).
2. Download the dataset.
3. Extract the contents of the .zip file.
4. Place the extracted data in the `data` folder of this project.
   - Ensure that the `data` folder structure remains unchanged.

## Project Structure

- **sleep_analysis_notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis.
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions.
- **preprocessing.py**: Contains functions for data processing.
